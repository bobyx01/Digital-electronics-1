![Logo](../../logolink_eng.jpg)

### Learning objectives



## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)




## Part 1: Synchronize Git and create a new folder




## Part 2: Project creation in Vivado



## Part 3: Multiplexer




## Synchronize repositories

Use [git commands](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/Digital-electronics-1/wiki/Git-useful-commands) to add, commit, and push all local changes to your remote repository. Check the repository at GitHub web page for changes.


## Experiments on your own

1. Complete your own tutorial for Vivado design flow in `Labs/03-vivado/README.md` file.


## Lab assignment

1. Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home). Submit:
    * Connection of 16 slide switches and 16 LEDs on Nexys A7 board.

2. Two-bit wide 4-to-1 multiplexer. Submit:
    * Listing of VHDL architecture from source file `mux_2bit_4to1.vhd` with syntax highlighting,
    * Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file `tb_mux_2bit_4to1.vhd` with syntax highlighting,
    * Screenshot with simulated time waveforms.

3. A Vivado tutorial. Submit:
    * Your tutorial for Vivado design flow: project creation, adding source file, adding testbench file, adding XDC constraints file, running simulation.

*Prepare all tasks in your README file `Digital-electronics-1/Labs/03-vivado/README.md`, [export/print it to PDF](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/Digital-electronics-1/wiki/Export-MD-to-PDF), use [BUT e-learning](https://moodle.vutbr.cz/) web page and submit a single PDF file. The deadline for submitting the task is the day before the next laboratory exercise.*
